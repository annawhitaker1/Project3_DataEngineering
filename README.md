## Overview 

This project analyzes global holidays and travel data to explore the relationship between holidays and travel trends. Using two datasets sourced from Kaggle, we built an ETL pipeline to process and load the data into a SQL database for efficient analysis. The project provides insights into how holidays influence global travel behavior, with applications in tourism and travel planning.
